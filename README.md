# SOEN341 Career Services Application

The objective of our project is to create a basic career services web application in which the students may apply to jobs created by employers on the site. This objective will be realized by allowing both students and employers to securely create an account using their email address and password on the site so they may find a job/employee.

Students will have the unique ability to create and modify their own candidate profile, while also being able to search through job postings.
Employers will be able to create job postings for the students to see, as well as review any submitted applications.

Employers will also receive a notification anytime a student applies to one of their postings.
Similarly, students will receive a notification if their application has been reviewed and they have received an interview from the employer.

This app makes searching for jobs super easy! All you need is a stable connection and a device, and you might find the job of your dreams!
